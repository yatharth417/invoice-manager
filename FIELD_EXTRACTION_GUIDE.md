# Complete Field Extraction Guide

## ‚úÖ All Fields Now Extracted

Your backend has been updated to extract **ALL 10 fields** from invoice PDFs:

### Fields Extracted:

1. **Invoice Number** (`invoice_number`)
   - The unique invoice/bill identifier
   - Examples: "INV-123", "F2019-0006224", "Bill #456"

2. **Invoice Date** (`invoice_date`)
   - The date when the invoice was issued
   - Examples: "31/07/2019", "2024-01-15"

3. **Due Date** (`due_date`)
   - The payment due date
   - Examples: "15/08/2019", "2024-02-15"

4. **Vendor Name** (`vendor_name`)
   - The company/person issuing the invoice
   - Examples: "ACME Corporation", "John's Services Ltd"

5. **Vendor Address** (`vendor_address`)
   - Complete address of the vendor
   - Examples: "123 Business St, New York, NY 10001, USA"

6. **Purchase Order** (`purchase_order`)
   - PO number if mentioned
   - Examples: "PO-12345", "PO#456"

7. **Account Number** (`account_number`)
   - Customer account/client ID
   - Examples: "ACC-789", "12345"

8. **Line Items** (`line_items`)
   - List of items/services with details
   - Format: Array of objects or formatted text

9. **Total Amount** (`total_amount`)
   - Final total to be paid (numeric only)
   - Examples: "1500.00", "1500"

10. **Currency** (`currency`)
    - Currency code or name
    - Examples: "USD", "EUR", "Dollar", "Euro"

## üéØ How It Works

### Backend (main.py)
- Enhanced system prompt with detailed instructions for each field
- Specific lookup terms for each field (e.g., "Look for: Invoice Date, Issue Date, Date")
- Clear rules to avoid confusion (e.g., invoice_date vs due_date)
- Better JSON parsing to handle markdown code blocks

### Frontend (InvoiceForm.jsx)
- File upload UI at top of form
- Extract button with loading state
- Automatic field mapping from API response
- Error handling and user feedback

### API Service (api.js)
- `extractInvoice(file, customPrompt)` function
- Default prompt asks for all 10 fields
- Returns structured JSON with all extracted data

## üß™ Testing

1. **Start Backend**:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\91886\invoice_\invoice-manager\backend
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**:
   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\91886\invoice_\invoice-manager
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Extraction**:
   - Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Click any invoice from dashboard
   - Upload a PDF invoice
   - Click "üîç Extract Data"
   - All 10 fields should auto-populate

## üìä Expected API Response

```json
{
  "invoice_number": "F2019-0006224",

```

## üîß Field Mapping (Backend ‚Üí Frontend)

| Backend Field      | Frontend Field    | Form Label          |

| invoice_date       | invoiceDate       | Invoice Date        |
| due_date           | dueDate           | Due Date            |

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Clear PDFs**: Better quality PDFs = better extraction
2. **Standard Formats**: Invoices with clear labels work best
3. **Review Data**: Always review extracted data before saving
4. **Edit As Needed**: You can manually edit any field after extraction
5. **Custom Prompts**: Add specific instructions for unique invoice formats

## üöÄ What's Next?

You can now:
- Upload any invoice PDF
- Extract all 10 fields automatically
- Review and edit the data
- Save to your invoice database

The AI model will do its best to find all fields, but some invoices may have missing data (will show as empty fields you can fill manually).
